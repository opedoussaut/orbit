# ORBIT

ORBIT explores how circular life-cycle sustainability knowledge can be formally structured using ontologies.

The repository contains a minimal ORIONT-aligned model, a synthetic example dataset, and SHACL shapes expressing basic completeness and consistency checks.

The main entry point is the Google Colab notebook:
